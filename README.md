About the Project
This repository contains a Python script for calculating simple interest, which is commonly used in micro-finance contexts. We believe that making financial tools and resources open-source can help build transparency and trust while fostering innovation. This repository is the first step in our transition from Subversion (SVN) to Git as part of our commitment to open-source development.
